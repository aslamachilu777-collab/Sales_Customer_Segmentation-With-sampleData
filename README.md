Sales Forecasting & Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)
📊 Project Overview
This project provides a data-driven approach to understanding sales trends and customer behavior. It transitions from a simple 3-Month Moving Average Forecast to a sophisticated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Segmentation model.

🛠 Features
Time-Series Forecasting: Uses a Rolling Mean to predict next month's sales targets.

RFM Analysis: Categorizes customers into segments (Champions, At Risk, Loyal, etc.) using statistical quintiles.

Automated Reporting: Generates a professional Excel report for stakeholders.

Visualizations: Includes distribution charts of customer segments and sales trends.

📈 The Segmentation Logic
I implemented an RFM model that scores customers from 1-5 across three metrics:

Recency: Days since last purchase.

Frequency: Total unique transaction dates.

Monetary: Total spend.
